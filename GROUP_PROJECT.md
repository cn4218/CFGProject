GROUP PROJECT TEMPLATE
This is the template that should be used by each group to provide a BRIEF progress update to their assigned instructor. The completed document should be submitted as a PR on GitHub in the project repository and assign the allocated instructor as reviewer. Alternatively, if your instructor agrees, you can also submit it via DM to him/her. The deadline is every Friday by 19:00. 
	
N.B! This template is just a starting point and not all sections need to be completed. It all depends on your progress and what you need more help within that particular week. Not submitting these reports will not affect your grade, but your instructor will not be able to provide feedback in any other way. 


	1.	Please describe your project idea. If this changes from the previous week, please describe how; if it does not change, please just copy the main objectives of the project. 

		Project Idea: A search engine for cosmetics which allows you to find items by ingredients. Using the open beauty facts (OBF) API: https://world.openbeautyfacts.org/ 


		Objectives: 

		- Enable users to search by ingredient X 
		- Allow users to search for items without ingredient Y
		- Or let users search for items with ingredient X but without ingredient Y
		- Enable users to search for products with 1st/2nd ingredient X (remove water)
		- Allow users to create an account
		- And let users create a wish list with items they would like to purchase/ save
		- Enable multi-criteria search (with A and B in first 3 ingredients but without C)
		- Let users filter by categories, location of stores, price of items etc




2.	What did the group (or each member of the group) work on this week?

- Front End Web Page - Chizu, Georgia & Nikita
- Backend Users & Wishlist API - Nikita, Sophie
- Backend Products API - Claire, Chizu
- Users & Wishlist DB - Nasian, Georgia, Nikita
- OBF_Cosmo_Products DB - Chizu, Claire (not using OBF DB directly)
- Users DB_Utils & Config - Nasian, Nikita
- Wishlist DB_Utils & Config - Nikita, Nasian
- Products DB_Utils & Config - Claire
    
  a.	What progress has been made? 
    
    - This week we had to restructure our database so the MySQL DB and Python- MySQL DB scripts have been re-written.
    - completed a first draft the users and wishlist databases (these databases are subject to change and can be changed accordingly as code develops)
    - Started working on the Wish list DB_Utils & Config
    - We have been working on Users DB_Utils & Config & the User routes file
    - The frontend scripts are almost complete 
    - We have also been working on the Backend products API
    - An SQL database for the OBF products has been created 
    
  b.	How would you evaluate your progress (e.g., exceptional, good, satisfactory, bad, etc.). Why?
    - Our progress is in a better place than last week, after having a long meeting this week it seems as if we're more aligned in what we have to complete and the tasks which everyone is working on. We also have a much better understanding on how each person's code will relate to the entire app itself. We're on a good path, and we're making progress, we had a few set backs this week in terms of having to re-do some of our scripts but overall it seems to be coming together very well. 
    - Had to start the databases work from scratch as we were trying to figure out the best way to accomplish it, but after our really long meeting this week it's a lot clearer what we have to accomplish and how to do it.



3.	What were the main challenges this week? 

  a.	How did you solve any issues encountered? What worked and what didn’t?
  - we has some issue with the user database and the MySQL/ MySQL-Python connector script which needed to be redone. When creating these scripts we were following lesson 19 when we needed to follow lesson 20 and so we have gone back over this and tried to fix it. 
  - Additionally, we had some issues with everyone being confused about their tasks and so there was some overlapping codes/ people doing similar tasks which we were able to sort out through our long meeting at the start of the week.

  b.	What is still to be solved and who is in charge of the task? How did you approach the issue so far? 
  -  Get all our seperate scripts to work together - everyone
  
  c. Please specifically mention any help you need from your instructor (we will also give general feedback and provide our thoughts and ideas, but this is your chance to specifically point to aspects where you are complete stuck). 


4.	What are the group’s main objectives for next week?
  - Have a minimal viable product (MVP) of our project complete
  - Complete the databases for users/ wishlist and get the route.py completed for both
