GROUP PROJECT TEMPLATE
This is the template that should be used by each group to provide a BRIEF progress update to their assigned instructor. The completed document should be submitted as a PR on GitHub in the project repository and assign the allocated instructor as reviewer. Alternatively, if your instructor agrees, you can also submit it via DM to him/her. The deadline is every Friday by 19:00. 
	
N.B! This template is just a starting point and not all sections need to be completed. It all depends on your progress and what you need more help within that particular week. Not submitting these reports will not affect your grade, but your instructor will not be able to provide feedback in any other way. 

Please describe your project idea. If this changes from the previous week, please describe how; if it does not change, please just copy the main objectives of the project.
