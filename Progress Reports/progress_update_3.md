## GROUP PROJECT TEMPLATE
This is the template that should be used by each group to provide a BRIEF progress update to their assigned instructor. The completed document should be submitted as a PR on GitHub in the project repository and assign the allocated instructor as reviewer. Alternatively, if your instructor agrees, you can also submit it via DM to him/her. The deadline is every Friday by 19:00. 
	
N.B! This template is just a starting point and not all sections need to be completed. It all depends on your progress and what you need more help within that particular week. Not submitting these reports will not affect your grade, but your instructor will not be able to provide feedback in any other way. 


	1.	Please describe your project idea. If this changes from the previous week, please describe how; if it does not change, please just copy the main objectives of the project. 

		Project Idea: A search engine for cosmetics which allows you to find items by ingredients. Using the open beauty facts (OBF) API: https://world.openbeautyfacts.org/ 


		Objectives: 

		- Enable users to search by ingredient X 
		- Allow users to search for items without ingredient Y
		- Or let users search for items with ingredient X but without ingredient Y
		- Enable users to search for products with 1st/2nd ingredient X (remove water)
		- Allow users to create an account
		- And let users create a wish list with items they would like to purchase/ save
		- Enable multi-criteria search (with A and B in first 3 ingredients but without C)
		- Let users filter by categories, location of stores, price of items etc

  	b.	How would you evaluate your progress (e.g., exceptional, good, satisfactory, bad, etc.). Why?
        - Making good progress towards a MVP which will hopefully be produced in next few days
        - UI is looking very nice 
        - Teamwork has improved and more discussion has been had over roles/ how to divide tasks ad activites, however still needs some improvement
        - Longer meetings seem to be more organised 
        - Tasks completed within small groups has worked well too


	3.	What were the main challenges this week?

        - Issues were encountered with communication. Seemingly communication within smaller groups works well. And there seems to be less repitition of code/work
        - Looping all the code together for MVP has been slight issue however communcation is improving


  	b.	What is still to be solved and who is in charge of the task? How did you approach the issue so far? 
  		-  Get all our seperate scripts to work together - everyone
        - Having more concise meetings/daily stand ups - everyone
  
  	c. Please specifically mention any help you need from your instructor (we will also give general feedback and provide our thoughts and ideas, but this is your chance to specifically point to aspects where you are complete stuck). 


	4.	What are the group’s main objectives for next week?
  		- Have a minimal viable product (MVP) of our project complete
  		- Start testing code and finalising the web app
        - Once MVP complete- new tasks?
        - Using OOP in code
        - Stat project document
